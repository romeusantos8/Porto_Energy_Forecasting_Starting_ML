# Energy Forecasting for Porto, Portugal

This project aims to forecast **solar energy production** and **energy consumption**
for the city of Porto using historical weather data and machine learning models.

## Objectives
- Collect meteorological data using the Open-Meteo API
- Engineer time-based and weather-based features
- Train baseline and tree-based regression models
- Evaluate model performance using standard regression metrics

## Data Sources
- Open-Meteo API (weather data)
- Public energy consumption datasets (to be integrated)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Status
🚧 Project in progress
